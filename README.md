My baby steps into GenAI

what is Gen AI ?

Type of Artificial intelligence that uses neural networks and deep learning algorithms to identify patterns within existing data as a basis for generating original content ?

Traditional AI, often referred to as machine learning (ML), has primarily focused on analytic tasks like classification

and prediction

What does Gen AI do ?

Traditional AI uses predictive models to classify data, recognize patterns, and predict outcomes within a specific context or domain, such as analyzing medical images to detect irregularities. 

Gen AI models generate entirely new outputs rather than simply making predictions based on prior experience

LLMs use Deep learning 

Central processing units (CPUs) are designed for general-purpose computing tasks, GPUs, initially developed for graphics rendering, are specialized processors that have proven to be adept at ML tasks due to their unique architecture

What is LLM?
An LLM is a general-purpose model primarily useful for tasks related to unstructured text data

Types of LLMs:
1) General purpose LLM
     a) Task specific LLM like Meta's Code Llama
     b)  Domain specific LLM like NVIDIA's bioBERT

GPT-3, a general-purpose LLM, was developed by OpenAI based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series of machine learning (ML) models. ChatGPT isn’t a language model
per se, but rather a user interface tailored around a particular language model such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, or GPT-4 

Domain-specific LLMs focus on a specific subject area or industry. For example, BioBERT is trained on biomedical text, making it an excellent resource for understanding scientific literature
and extracting information from medical documents. CodeBERT is a cybersecurity solution that has been trained to assist with IT security concerns such as vulnerability detection, code review,
and software security analysis. 

Technology behind LLM: CNN or Complex recurrent structures

Key terms and concepts in LLM:
a) prompt : the text you provide to the language model
b) completion: the result produced by the model
c) inference: process of using model to generate text

  Frameworks and Developer Tools
  Open AI GPT Playground
  Snowflake Cortex
  Hugging face Transformer library 
  //TODO what are others?

Governance: Models need data , instead of moving data to models , to ensure security move models to where data resides to ensure security

history :

What is classification?
What is prediction ?
What is deep learning ?
What are neural networks ?
Are inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. These software systems use interconnected nodes (neurons) to process information
What is the USP of Gen AI which relies on deep learning and neural networks ? What's the gap in these ?
What is NLP ?
What are CNN ? {convolutional neural networks } ? – Computer vision tasks
What are RNN ? {Recurrent neural networks} ? – sequential data processing 
What are LLMs ? {Large language models }
What are Multimodal language model ?
  Multimodal, meaning it handles both text and other media such as images.
  
Forbes article :  Transformers Revolutionized AI

Google's : Transformer architecture – a deep learning model that replaced traditional recurrent and convolutional structures with a new type of architecture that’s particularly effective at

understanding and contextualizing language, as well as generating text, images, audio, and computer code.

Example OpenAI's Chatgpt is on Transformer's architecture

CPU vs GPU ? - high level understanding ?

GPUs have a large number of cores that can process multiple

tasks simultaneously. Transformers use GPUs to process multiple

threads of information, leading to faster training of AI models

that effectively handle not just text but also images, audio, and

video content.
