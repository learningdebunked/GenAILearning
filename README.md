My baby steps into GenAI

what is Gen AI ?

Type of Artificial intelligence that uses neural networks and deep learning algorithms to identify patterns within existing data as a basis for generating original content ?

Traditional AI, often referred to as machine learning (ML), has primarily focused on analytic tasks like classification

and prediction

What does Gen AI do ?

Traditional AI uses predictive models to classify data, recognize

patterns, and predict outcomes within a specific context or domain,

such as analyzing medical images to detect irregularities. Gen AI

models generate entirely new outputs rather than simply making

predictions based on prior experience

LLMs use Deep learning 

Central processing units (CPUs) are designed for general-purpose computing tasks, GPUs, initially developed for graphics rendering, are specialized processors that have proven to be adept at ML tasks due to their unique architecture

history :

What is classification?
What is prediction ?
What is deep learning ?
What are neural networks ?
Are inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. These software systems use interconnected nodes (neurons) to process information
What is the USP of Gen AI which relies on deep learning and neural networks ? What's the gap in these ?
What is NLP ?
What are CNN ? {convolutional neural networks } ? – Computer vision tasks
What are RNN ? {Recurrent neural networks} ? – sequential data processing 
What are LLMs ? {Large language models }
What are Multimodal language model ?

Transformers Revolutionized AI

Google's 

Transformer architecture – 

a deep learning model

that replaced traditional recurrent and convolutional structures

with a new type of architecture that’s particularly effective at

understanding and contextualizing language, as well as generat-

ing text, images, audio, and computer code.

Example OpenAI's Chatgpt is on Transformer's architecture 




ChatGPT - full form :

Chatbot Generative Pre-trained Transformer




CPU vs GPU ? - high level understanding ?

GPUs have a large number of cores that can process multiple

tasks simultaneously. Transformers use GPUs to process multiple

threads of information, leading to faster training of AI models

that effectively handle not just text but also images, audio, and

video content.
